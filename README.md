# HOMEWORKS - PROGRAMMING 1
My solutions to the homeworks of the Programming 1 course (in Python). Together with the test carried out in the laboratory, it contributed to the score: 30 cum laude!

Topics:
✅ Python fundamentals: strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, etc...
✅ Images (lists of lists)
✅ Recursion
✅ Trees 
✅ Basics of object-oriented programming

Just to interest you a little in taking a look at these works.... look at the Easter egg I found.
