# HOMEWORKS - PROGRAMMING 1
My solutions to the homeworks of the Programming 1 course (in Python).

GRADE: 30 CUM LAUDE

Topics:
- ✅ Python fundamentals: strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, etc...
- ✅ Images (lists of lists)
- ✅ Recursion
- ✅ Trees 
- ✅ Basics of object-oriented programming

Just to interest you a little in taking a look at these works.... look at the Easter egg I found.
