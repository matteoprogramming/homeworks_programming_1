My code implement the following algorithm:
1) given the original and the corrupted images and the side,
   creates a list of subimages for both images
2) then it compares the images on the same positon to understand
   rotation applied and obtained what should be returned by the function
3) join all subkeys to obain a string that is necessary for the decription
4) extract the corrupted file and decrypts it implementing the algorithm 
   given in the decription and the save this file in the path indicated
5) return the list of subkeys

Buona Immacolata!
